The Classic MIDI FeatherWing interface is an Adafruit Feather-compatible module. Deriving its power from the host Feather's 3.3V power, the interface converts incoming and outgoing classic MIDI current-loop input and output to Feather UART (RX and TX) logic pins.

The wing provides input and output footprints for 3.5mm TRS Type B and DIN-5 connectors. The MIDI input is an optically-isolated connection. MIDI output is buffered and current-limited. On-board receive (RX) and transmit (TX) LEDs indicate incoming and outgoing signals.

The STEMMA MIDI interface was tested with CircuitPython version 4.0.1. Example code is provided in the repository. Additional examples can be found within the _adafruit__midi_ CircuitPython library distribution.
